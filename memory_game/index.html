	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<p>In this version of Memory we will match the Hiragana to the correct Romanji to make a pair! For example あ mtaches with A, え matches with E, い matches with I, お matched with O, う matches with U and so on until you have matched all 46 characters! Get ready to play Shinkei-suijaku!　がんばってください！ </p>
